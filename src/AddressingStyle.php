 *
 * S3-compatible providers disagree about where the bucket name belongs,
 * and the choice is not cosmetic: it changes both the `Host` header and
 * the canonical URI, so signing one way and requesting the other fails
 * with an opaque `SignatureDoesNotMatch`.
 *
 *   Path            https://endpoint/bucket/key
 *   Virtual-hosted  https://bucket.endpoint/key
 *
 * Rough state of play:
 *
 *   - **Cloudflare R2** — path-style against the account endpoint.
 *   - **AWS S3** — virtual-hosted. Path-style is deprecated for buckets
 *     created in newer regions.
 *   - **Backblaze B2** — virtual-hosted.
 *   - **DigitalOcean Spaces** — virtual-hosted (path-style also works).
 *   - **MinIO / Ceph** — path-style, typically.
